### Project Overview

 It is a Students Management System Project. In this, we creating a students roaster, checking who scored the most in mathematics, grading, etc.



### Learnings from the project

 In this project, I learned to create dictionaries, apply basic operations on dictionaries, basic maths, arithmetic operators and some standard function.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The best way that I used is to keep the basics clear, go step wise : one step at a time.
 When basics aren't clear you may end up getting stuck. 


### Challenges faced

 A little code error but that's fine as I was able to correct them.
